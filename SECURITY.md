### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

Please include the following details in your report:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- The potential impact of the vulnerability
- Any mitigation or workaround if known
- Your name and affiliation (if any) for acknowledgment

### Our Commitment

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 3 business days
- We will confirm the vulnerability and determine its impact
- We will keep you informed of the progress towards resolving the issue
- We will notify you when the vulnerability has been fixed
- We will publicly acknowledge your responsible disclosure (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Bug Bounty

At this time, we do not offer a paid bug bounty program. However, we would be happy to acknowledge your contribution in our release notes and on our website.

## Secure Development Practices

### Dependencies

We regularly update our dependencies to include security fixes. You can check for known vulnerabilities in our dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
# For Python dependencies (backend)
pip-audit

# For JavaScript/Node.js dependencies (frontend)
npm audit
```

### Code Review

All code changes are reviewed by at least one other developer before being merged into the main branch. We pay special attention to:

- Input validation
- Authentication and authorization
- Data protection and privacy
- Secure communication
- Error handling and logging

### Security Headers

Our web application implements the following security headers:

- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-Frame-Options
- X-XSS-Protection
- Referrer-Policy
- Permissions-Policy

### Data Protection

- All sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- API keys and secrets are never committed to version control
- We follow the principle of least privilege for database access

### Authentication

- We use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication
- Tokens have a limited lifetime and can be revoked
- We implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- We support multi-factor authentication (MFA) for additional security

### Secure Communication

- All communication is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher
- We use secure protocols and ciphers
- We implement HSTS to ensure HTTPS is always used

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Protecting Your Account

- Use a strong, unique password for your account
- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) if available
- Never share your API keys or credentials
- Regularly monitor your account activity
- Log out from shared or public computers

### API Key Security

- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables or secret management tools
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Set appropriate permissions and IP restrictions when possible
- Monitor API usage for suspicious activity

## Responsible Disclosure Policy

We follow responsible disclosure guidelines:

1. **Do not** exploit the vulnerability to access or modify data without permission
2. **Do not** use attacks on physical security, social engineering, or DDoS attacks
3. **Do not** publicly disclose the vulnerability before we've had time to address it
4. **Do** make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and service disruptions

We release security updates as needed. Please ensure you are running the latest version of the application and its dependencies.
